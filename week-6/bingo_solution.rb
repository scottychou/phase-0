# A Nested Array to Model a Bingo Board SOLO CHALLENGE

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline:


# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
  # Create a random integer to access an array of letters containing "bingo".
  # Create a random integer between 1 and 100.

# Check the called column for the number called.
  # Create a variable to hold whether any number is equal and initialize
  # to false.
  # Iterate through each array in the board
    # IF number is equal to array value
      # set variable to true
    # ELSE
      # leave variable at false
  # Return variable holding whether number is equal

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'
  # Set the value of the number to the string 'x'.

# Display a column to the console
  # LOOP through each array on the board.
    # print out the value for the relevant column

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  # LOOP through each array on the board.
    # LOOP within each array
      # Print out the value
    #Print out a new line

# Initial Solution

# class BingoBoard

#   def initialize(board)
#     @letters = ['B','I','N','G','O']
#     @bingo_board = board
#   end

#   def call
#     num = rand(101)
#     letter = @letters[Random.rand(5)]
#     return letter, num
#   end
  
#   def check(letter,num) #replace number with "X"
#     @bingo_board.each do |row|
#       if row[@letters.find_index(letter)] == num
#         row[@letters.find_index(letter)] = 'X'
#       end
#     end
#   end

#   def display
#     @bingo_board.each do |row|
#       row.each do |fivethings|
#         print fivethings.to_s + ' '
#       end
#       puts
#     end
#   end
# end

# Refactored Solution

class BingoBoard

  def initialize(board)
    @letters = ['B','I','N','G','O']
    @bingo_board = board
  end

  def call # Method returns a letter and a number
    letter = @letters[Random.rand(5)]
    number = Random.rand(99) + 1
    return letter, number
  end

  def check(letter, number) # Replace number with string
    col = @letters.find_index(letter)
    @bingo_board.each do |row|
        row[col] = 'X' if row[col] == number
    end
  end

  def display() # displays the board
    @bingo_board.each do |row|
      row.each do |item|
        printf("%2s ",item.to_s)
      end
      puts
    end
  end
end


#DRIVER CODE (I.E. METHOD CALLS) GO BELOW THIS LINE
board = [[47, 44, 71, 8, 88],
        [22, 69, 75, 65, 73],
        [83, 85, 97, 89, 57],
        [25, 31, 96, 68, 51],
        [75, 70, 54, 80, 83]]

new_game = BingoBoard.new(board)
letter, num = new_game.call
new_game.check('B', 47)
new_game.display

#Reflection
=begin
* How difficult was pseudocoding this challenge? What do you think of
your pseudocoding style?
  ** It was difficult for me to pseudo-code this challenge at times
  because I thought certain methods were easier to code in Ruby than
  they were in pseudo-code. I just need more practice with pseudo-code
  so that my style can be more clear/concise.
* What are the benefits of using a class for this challenge?
  ** Using a class allows you to keep all of the methods/variables that
  deal with the class inside the object implementation. This helps with
  separation of concerns. It is also good object oriented design.
* How can you access coordinates in a nested array?
  ** You can access coordinates in an a nested array using to sets of
  indices such as nested_array[x][y].
* What methods did you use to access and modify the array?
  ** I used each loops to access and modify the contents of the array.
  I also referenced the items via indices.
* How did you determine what should be an instance variable versus a
local variable?
  ** All variables that dealt with the state of the bingo board were
  created as instance variables.
* What do you feel is most improved in your refactored solution?
  **The refactored solution is much easier to read. The greatest
  impact was in the display function where I was able to make the
  formatting nicer with printf rather than gibberish print statements.
