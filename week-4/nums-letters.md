    What does puts do?
    -puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line

    What is an integer? What is a float?
    -an integer is a whole number
    -a float is a number with a decimal after it

    What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
    -Integer division always rounds down to the nearest integer.  So if I did 5/2, the answer would be 3. For float division, it would be 5.0/2.0=2.5.


CHALLENGE 4.2 



RELEASE 2:

```
puts 365*24 
* hours in a year


puts 10*365*24*60
* begin minutes in a decade

```



    How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
    Ruby handles them as integers or floats depending on how you specify them to be.

    What is the difference between integers and floats?
    -an integer is a whole number
    -a float is a number with a decimal after it

    What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
    -Strings are blocks of text.  You would use them when you want to output text instead of numbers.

    What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
    -A local variable is a variable which is either a variable declared within the function or is an argument passed to a function. As you may have encountered in your programming, if we declare variables in a function then we can only use them within that function.

    How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
    This challenge was easy, it was great review of what we learned for the admissions part of DBC.
