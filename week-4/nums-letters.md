    What is an integer? What is a float?

    -a float is a number with a decimal after it

    What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

    Integer division always rounds down to the nearest integer.  So if I did 5/2, the answer would be 3. For float division, it would be 5.0/2.0=2.5.
