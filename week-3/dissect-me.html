      If you don't get a bang from the title of my blog, you don't understand the title or the pun in this sentence, and you're not really part of the target audience for this blog, which is tech savvy people, including those who I may be working with soon, since this has been my first week with Dev Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first topic is git. Lots of puns here too, especially for a Texan who knows a contemptible person who needs to skedaddle. But it is time to stop the puns and get on to serious business. I first encountered GitHub a few months ago because HackReactor wanted me to have an account there. I found the website extremely difficult to understand, in part because I didn't know git. Now, with some help from Dev Bootcamp, I do. Allow me to explain.

      In my previous lives as lawyer and consultant, we handled version control by saving multiple copies of documents with slightly varying names that made it possible but not easy to revert to a prior version or retrieve useful work product that had been deleted in revisions. Consolidating work from multiple contributors was called "holding the master" and sometimes seemed like a full-time job. Eventually the consulting firm came up with a system that purported to manage version control, but produced conflicts any time more than one person worked on the document at a time remotely, or avoid those conflicts by refusing access to any other user if the first user was connected to the server. At its best, the system was like handing around a physical master on paper.

    </p>
    <p>
      Later the consulting firm came out with a "better" system that allowed fewer conflicting versions by relying on almost constant connections to the server, but it still didn't allow collaborative work on documents from multiple people at the same time, and no tracking at all of metadata about the changes people were making. I now see what software developers use, and it makes me despair over what we went through, though I do have to acknowledge that I don't think the system would work elegantly on PowerPoint or Excel documents. But for programmers and others who work with text documents, the system is wonderful. The software is called git, and GitHub is a website that provides tools and resources to support git users, including developers writing open source or private code.

      Git offers sophisticated version control including features that go beyond what I thought version control meant.  Multiple users can work on the same master set of documents (let's call it a project) at the same time and their changes can all be incorporated back into the master when complete. Not only that, but there are detailed comments explaining the creator, nature, and purpose of each set of changes. It's also easy to revert to a prior version if there are problems with the current one.  Sort of like a super "undo" function. A git user doesn't have to worry about how or when to save a new version as work progresses.  S/he just enters "commit" in git and it captures all the changes since the last commit, accompanied by a comment explaining what's been done.  
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub not only provides a central, remote repository for the project, but also has tools that make the job of "holding the master" a breeze. When a team member has completed work on a set of changes, s/he creates a "pull request" that makes the master owner aware of the changes and their purpose, shows the changes in a side by side comparison, and allows adoption of them with the click of a button. All I can say is WOW!
    </p>

      GitHub offers me, a budding developer, a place to store my projects, allowing people to freely (or less freely if I so choose) look at my work, borrow from it, suggest improvements to it that I can easily accept or reject, and so on. As I grow into a great developer writing elegant, clear, and creative code, I won't just tell people I can do it, I'll be able to show it to them on GitHub. But for now, GitHub is just hosting this blog. Which is sort of like using your Ferrari to drive your kid to school. Or a howitzer to persuade a git to git.

      Until next time, git along lil' doogie.
