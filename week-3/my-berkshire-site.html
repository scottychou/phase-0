<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
I thought it was really neat to take my Codecademy learning and actually be able to replicate the basic structure of a website.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I thought the research was pretty straight forward and we were able to find some useful tags such as <hr />, which helped us complete our assignment efficiently.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I think that, for the most part, we were able to keep our formatting neat and organized with the proper spacing and indentations.  It could probably use a little more practice, but so far, all the functionality is working.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems good in the sense that, it's not too difficult to learn.  At least, all the basic tags have been extremely easy to remember.  They seem to follow the format of <></> most of the time.  What seems bad about HTML, is that there is now HTML5 and some of the commands I learned have changed slightly.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML? 
Head, shoulders, knees and toes.  Except with HTML, it's - head, body, footer.  It's pretty intuitive to know what goes where.  A short list of tricks/things to remember.

Define the DOCTYPE.
Everything goes inside open and closed <html> tags.
Then comes your head, which can include a title.
Then comes your body, which can include headers, paragraphs etc.
The comes your footer, which can also include headers, paragraphs etc.

You can insert ordered lists, <ol> or unordered lists <ul>.  and you can also include horizontal line breaks, which is just a closing bracket <hr />
