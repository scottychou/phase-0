    What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

    -Information Gathering - This is where you decide what your target audience is, what the purpose of the site is, and how the web can be utilized to achieve your goals.

    -Planning - This is where your site map is developed.  You will need to plan out how you want your web site to flow.  The site map is a list of all main topic areas of the site, as well as sub-topics.  It's important that it is intuitive and easy to understand.

    -Design - This is where you decide what you want the site to visually look like, such as layout, colors and font - the aesthetics.  Depending on who this website caters to, it may look different.  A website geared towards teenagers is going to look different than a website geared toward business professionals.

    -Development - Simply put, this is where you add HTML or CSS to make the site look like the design

    -Testing and Delivery - essentially, this is where you check all the links to make sure they work and get feedback from others

    -Maintenance - You are never necessarily REALLY done with your website.  Continuous improvement and updates can help bring back repeat customers or new customers, people like new content.

    What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

    My site's primary goal is to introduce the reader to who I am, my adventures through DBC via blog posts, and the projects I work on.  Eventually, I imagine this website will be geared towards luring potential employers.
    
    What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

    My target audience's interest (future employers) will be to gauge my coding and designing ability.  And my site will be addressing them by displaying my blog posts, projects, and visual design.

    What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

    The primary action would be to view my portfolio and check out my work.  And ideally, to contact me about possible opportunities.

    What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
    What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

    The main things someone should know about design and UX, is that it is the process of enhancing user satisfaction by improving the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.  As a coder, it is more important than you may think.  It is just as important as the coding, and the two go hand in hand.  You will need a good design if you want to lure people into your site.  The site needs to be easy to navigate or it could be a huge turn off to the viewer.  Personally, I wouldn't even give a bad website a second of my time.
    
    Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
    I found the part where I had to look for a tool to make a site map the most tedious.  It's basically just new software that I need to learn, and how to navigate.  So I end up spending a lot of time to look for the correct button to press, so that it does what I want it to do.
