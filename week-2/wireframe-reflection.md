A wireframe is basically the visual design given to a web page - it provides the skeletal framework.  Wireframing has the benefits of creating structure for your page to make it more user friendly and easier to navigate, and helps with organizing your content on any given page.  Also, it helps with the coding process since you will already know what you need on the page.

I found it enjoyable to wireframe my site using a free wireframing site called Mockingbird.  It had many features such as adding in buttons, and avatars and dropdown menus etc.  I revised my wireframe multiple times, and I am sure that I will do so again in the future.

I think the most challenging part of this assignment was adding wireframe images inline using markdown.  I had to navigate into different repositories and it probably took me 5-6 tries to finally get it right.  It was quite annoying and I had to use the git add and git commit and git origin pull master command many many times.  I did however, enjoy desigining my wireframe though.
