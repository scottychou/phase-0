What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was having a little trouble with branching and remembering to add and delete them before and after projects. I also learned that I somehow merged branches I shouldn't have at some point last week.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I learned a few shortcuts for using the command line. It was also helpful pairing in both roles because it allowed me to both be the one typing out the syntax and the one guiding how things are done, as well as researching.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked questions about syntax mostly, and since I was on Mac and my partner PC we had a few questions about the differences. We also were unsure on why using the master branch was frowned upon.

What still confuses you about git?

I'm still a little confused with branching and how deleting and merging them work. Repetition will be the answer to that though.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I had a good time pairing, it was nice to work with someone else, and to see that they had similar struggles that I did. It's reassuring to realize we're all in the same boat and that we need to help keep each other afloat.
