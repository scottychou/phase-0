#THIS IS MY REFLECTION FOR GPS 1.1
    
The git concepts I was struggling with the most were the feature branch and the pull requests.  I accidently did the "bad practice" of not having a feature branch and pushing from the master branch.  And man, did that simplify things a lot - I didn't even have to do a pull and merge request after that, along with deleting the branch.

So during my GPS, I really solidified my understanding of the feature branch by using the "git branch featurebranchname" command and the "git checkout featurebranchname" command to switch to the new branch.

Another concept that I was unfamiliar with was the "git merge file1 file2" command since I didn't have much exposure previously.  During the GPS, these concepts were clarified for me, and I found it really helpful.

I asked questions to my pair and guide whenever I felt like I needed clarification on a topic I felt I was weak on, or when we ended up getting errors.  For example, my pair accidently made a feature branch before we even cloned any repo's, which ended up slowing us down later with some errors, we had to ask our guide to help troubleshoot for when we had erroneous syntax.  Another example was when I was unfamiliar with the merge syntax, my pair was more familiar with it, and able to help out.

I'm still a little confused about the "git fetch" command, I feel like I haven't really used that, so I'll have some fun research time soon.

Overall, I really like my first experience of pairing in a GPS.  It was really fun because I actually got to interact with someone.  It's nice to have a couple of people to lean on and get their take on things.  It's also really nice to have confirmation on if something is right or not.  I personally prefer working in a team than individually, and am more extroverted than introverted, so this was great.  I definitely look forward to future GPS's.
