 // Manipulating JavaScript Objects

// I worked on this challenge: [by myself, with: ]

// There is a section below where you will write your code.

// DO NOT ALTER THIS OBJECT BY ADDING ANYTHING WITHIN THE CURLY BRACES!
var terah = {
  name: "Terah",
  age: 32,
  height: 66,
  weight: 130,
  hairColor: "brown",
  eyeColor: "brown"
}
// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.

var adam = {
  name: "Adam",
}

terah.spouse = adam;
terah.weight = 125;
delete terah.eyeColor;
adam.spouse = terah;
terah.children = {};
terah.children.carson = {name: "Carson"};
terah.children.carter = {name: "Carter"};
terah.children.colton = {name: "Colton"};
adam.children = terah.children;

// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines
//
//    What tests did you have trouble passing? What did you do to make it pass? Why did that work?
//    -I started having trouble when I needed to add an object to an object to an object.  Specifically, adding in the children proved to be a challenge.  I needed to google how to solve that.
//    -I passed it by making another set of curly braces which I didn't know I could do.  It worked because that's how you set new name variables.

//    How difficult was it to add and delete properties outside of the object itself?
//    Adding and deleting properties were incredibly simple, it's just very straightforward, the code speaks for itself.

//    What did you learn about manipulating objects in this challenge?
//    -I learned that you can just assume the object already exists, and just assign a values to it, and it will work.  For deleting something, make sure the delete function is in front of the object you want to delete.
