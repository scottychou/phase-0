    Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
    -To create a repository on GitHub, go to your profile page, and in the top right, there should be a green "Create Repository" button.  Enter in what you want your path to be called, then select public and add a MIT license to it and hit "Create".  To clone it to your computer, go to your GitHub page of choice and copy the URL in the middle right.  Then, in your command prompt, make sure you are in the correct directory that you want to clone into.  Use a "git clone URL" command and you are set.

    Describe what open source means.
    Open source means free and other people are able to view your code and use it for whatever they want, such as modify it.

    What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
    I think open source is a great way for projects to develop and for people to collaborate.  I have a very neutral stance on it.  For the purposes of my education, it certainly doesn't make me feel nervous or protective.  But if I were to own a private company, I probably wouldn't favor open source so much.

    Assess the importance of using licenses.
    Licenses are automatically copyrighted, so if you have a license declaring that you are open source, it will basically say that anyone can do anything with your code, and you don't care what they do with it.  It can also allow people to help you out with your code, since they will be able to view it and modify it.

    What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
    Although I didn't really struggle with anything during this challenge, I would say that it helped solidified my understanding of pushing my local directory into my GitHub through the command line.

    Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
    No, I did not feel the need to.
