# Week 1.1 Reflection


I learned about meditation, having a growth mindset, Pomodoro technique, time boxing, and counter-intuitive productivity.

Of the above, I felt like time boxing was the most immediately applicable to me and interesting.  It is a previously agreed period of time where you work steadily towards completion of some goal. Rather than allow work to continue till the goal is reached, you stop work when the time limit is reached then evaluate your progress. For example, the Pomodoro technique works around 25 minute time boxes.

I currently just set aside time and try to do it all at once, or until I get tired or bored, and although it is currently working out for me, I believe if I employ a new method such as the pomodoro technique, it may show better results in the long run.  By employing this new technique, I will avoid the burn out feeling and be able to refocus at every 25 minute check point.  I also believe that this technique will be a good starting plan for my phase 0 development.  I'll evaluate after a couple weeks and see if it is working out for me.

# Week 1.2 Reflection


I learned that a shell is a command language interpreter, and bash is the shell that I will be using.  I feel like the most challenging part of this material is/was learning all the commands.  Most of the commands are pretty intuitive and easy to remember, but since this is all new material to me, it will be challenging memorizing a large amount of new things.  I was able to successfully use all of the commands in the crash course, but I'm sure that I am still quite the novice and will need a lot more practice to become a master at it.

I think the most important commands will be "pwd", "ls", "cd", "mkdir" and "mv".  These are all very simple commands that I feel will be very commonly used.

    Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-pwd - print working directory

-ls - lists directory

-mv - move a file or directory

-cd - change directory

-../ - move up a directory

-touch - make an empty file, in windows it is "New-Item", I think this will be uncommonly used.

-mkdir - make a directory

-less - I use windows, so this should be "more" which allows you to page through a file

-rmdir - remove directory

-rm - remove

-help - read a manual page
